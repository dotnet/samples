# Multithreading in WPF: Use the dispatcher to run code while idle

This app demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject> to run code while the app is idle.

This sample app supports the [WPF Threading Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/threading-model?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8) article.
