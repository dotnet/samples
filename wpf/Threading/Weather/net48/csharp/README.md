# Multithreading in WPF: Use Task to invoke code asynchronously

This app demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> and async/await keywords to get and display data asynchronously.

This sample app supports the [WPF Threading Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/threading-model?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8) article.
