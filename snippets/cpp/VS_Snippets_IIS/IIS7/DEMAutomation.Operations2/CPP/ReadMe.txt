    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Operations2 Project Overview

AppWizard has created this Operations2 application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Operations2 application.


Operations2.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Operations2.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Operations2.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
