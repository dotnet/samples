              Setting the certificateValidationMode to PeerOrChainTrust means that if the certificate 
              is in the user's Trusted People store, then it will be trusted without performing a
              validation of the certificate's issuer chain. This setting is used here for convenience so that the 
              sample can be run without having to have certificates issued by a certificate authority (CA).
              This setting is less secure than the default, ChainTrust. The security implications of this 
              setting should be carefully considered before using PeerOrChainTrust in production code.
