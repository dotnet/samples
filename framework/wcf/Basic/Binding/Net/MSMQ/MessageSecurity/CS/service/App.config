               The serviceCredentials behavior allows one to define a service certificate.
               A service certificate is used by the service to authenticate itself to its clients and to provide message protection.
               This configuration references the "localhost" certificate installed during the setup instructions.

            Setting the certificateValidationMode to PeerOrChainTrust means that if the certificate 
            is in the user's Trusted People store, then it will be trusted without performing a
            validation of the certificate's issuer chain. This setting is used here for convenience so that the 
            sample can be run without having to have certificates issued by a certificate authority (CA).
            This setting is less secure than the default, ChainTrust. The security implications of this 
            setting should be carefully considered before using PeerOrChainTrust in production code.
