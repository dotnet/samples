# .NET Core parallel programming with PLINQ

The sample source code is a .NET Core Console application written in C#, that demonstrates some of the ways PLINQ query execution may be controlled and configured.

## Sample prerequisites

This sample is written in C# and targets .NET Core 3.1. It requires the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

## Types and members in use

The sample source code uses the following types and members:

- `ParallelEnumerable.Range`
  - `.WithMergedOptions()`
    - `ParallelMergeOptions.FullyBuffered`
    - `ParallelMergeOptions.NotBuffered`
  - `.WithCancellation()`
  - `.WithDegreeOfParallelism()`

## Building the sample

The source code includes an MSBuild project file for C# (a *.csproj* file) that targets .NET Core 3.1. After you download the *.zip* file containing the example code, create a directory and select **Download ZIP** to download the sample code files to your computer. To build the example:

1. Download the *.zip* file containing.
1. Create the directory to which you want to copy the files.
1. Copy the files from the *.zip* file to the directory you just created.
