# .NET Standard parallel extensions extras

In 2010, [Stephen Toub](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/author/toub/) authored a blog series called ["A Tour of ParallelExtensionsExtras"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/a-tour-of-parallelextensionsextras/). At the time, there was a companion library of extensions that was based on .NET Framework 4. The sample source code has been ported from the original to .NET Standard 2.1.
